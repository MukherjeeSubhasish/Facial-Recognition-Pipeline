The python code in this repo shows highest accuracy obtained on the test-dataset. Due to resource/time constraint I could only use 3 epochs. But, it is clear from the log file that, with higher epochs the model would perform even better. I have uploaded the plots for your reference too. Please let me know if you have any questions.
ArcFace loss function was the game changer whereas standard cross_entropy_loss could not deliver higest quality for this task. Also, since our task here is clustering, not supervised learning— asking the models to learn how to produce better embedding is better as compared to pass two image as input and pass 1/0 as label which means if the images are of the same person or not. I expected pairwise learning would perform better in this case but that was not the case.
